This is a collection of various projects and notes relating to Machine Learning
Mathematics and Statistics, created during the course of my career in Data Analytics
my recent time as a mature student of Mathematics, Statistics and Machine Learning at
The Open University and Birkbeck, University of London.

[Stylometry Toolkit](https://github.com/chriskward/stylometry-toolkit)
A collection of python tools (compatible with Pandas and sklearn) to effectively and efficiently express text in character-n-gram form
for the purposes of stylistic analysis and authorship classification.

<br>

[Numerical Methods](https://github.com/chriskward/numerical-methods)
Code and notebooks exploring gradient descent with numpy and curve rectification/interpolation. Still a work in progresss with more to be
added shortly.

<br>

[Markov Language Model](https://github.com/chriskward/markov-language-model)
A lightweight character based language model that can be used for text classification and generation

<br>

[Simulation of Random Variables](https://github.com/chriskward/random-variables}
Create discrete and continuous random variable objects using any probability density or mass function. Generate random samples and carry out probabilistic calculations.
The code in this repo applies many of the functions developed in [numerical methods](https://github.com/chriskward/numerical-methods)
